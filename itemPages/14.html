    <meta name="description" content="A bed is a block that allows a player to sleep and to reset their spawn point to within a few blocks of the bed in the Overworld. If the bed is obstructed, the player spawns at the default world spawning location. \nWell I recommend to have one bed in your house and have one with you when you travel in the world. \nMaybe your asking yourself why I need a bed when I’m traveling in the world, Well I travel like this and it’s a recommendation from me. \nWhen it gets dark all the zombies start to spawn and skeletons the same. Well they will kill you! And you don’t want that, When it gets close to night build a wall around yourself and sleep till you reach the morning ;)
