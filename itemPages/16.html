(Use Iron pickaxe for mining them). \nWhen you start mining there is a chance that you spend two or three days in the mine, so you have to carry a lot of pickaxes other wise you have to travel all the way back to the base!!!. I suggest to have at least 8 pickaxes with you, And don’t worry about the storage they will be destroyed along the way and give you space to store items :).">
